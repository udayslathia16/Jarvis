# Jarvis AI Assistant

Welcome to Jarvis, an AI assistant that can communicate like humans and perform various tasks. Jarvis is designed to assist you with day-to-day activities, provide information, and automate certain processes. This readme will guide you through the installation, setup, and usage of Jarvis.

# Installation

To install Jarvis, please follow these steps:

Clone the Jarvis repository from GitHub or obtain the installation files from the official source.

Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed on your system, such as Python 3.x and the necessary libraries mentioned in the requirements file.

Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to isolate Jarvis and its dependencies from your global Python environment.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Download and set up any additional resources or models required by Jarvis, such as language models or speech recognition models. These files should be placed in the appropriate directories as instructed in the documentation.

For MAC we can use "say" command for dictate whatever sentence you enter between the double quotes in the default system voice whereas for Windows we need to install modules like "win32com.client" to do the same function

Configure any environment variables or settings that are necessary for Jarvis to function correctly. Refer to the configuration section for more details.

# Setup

Add your api key in config.py file

Active the virtual environment
